# 1. CompareTheTriple_Array.py
The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

# sample input 
# 5 6 7
# 3 6 10
# sample output
# 1 1

# 2. SumOfAll_Array.py
long: the sum of all array elements
# sample input 
# 5
# 1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005
# sample output
# 5000000015

# 3. diagonalDifference_Array.py
For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
# sample input 
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 9 8 9 
The left-to-right diagonal 1+5+9 = 15 . The right to left diagonal 3+5+9= 17 . Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2
sample output
# 2
